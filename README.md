# steve-apollo-test

This repository contains the necessary specifications to build an Event Driven Data Layer based on the requirements gathered with Apollo.

Each file inside the **[events](events)** folder corresponds to a single use case or site event that needs to be implemented.
These will be used to share data with the tag management tool of choice and to trigger the corresponding tracking events in the analytics tool of choice.

The implementation instructions for the Tag Management Solutions are inside the **[implementation](implementation)** folder.

For any questions or comments, please contact **[Insert architect email]**.
